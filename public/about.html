		<p> Chitchat was started by Moumita in 2012. A friend asked Moumita to help his mother with English conversations and Moumita agreed to do a few lessons. But soon she started getting requests for classes from other non-English speakers travelling to San Francisco. She was really enjoying teaching English and helping others improve their language skills, and that's when she decided to start Chitchat officially! <br> <br>

		<em>Currently Chitchat has students across 8 countries - USA, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Chile, Japan, Korea and France. Chitchat's classes aim to make students confident English-speakers by providing them with the right tools and personalizing classes to suit their specific needs.</em></p>
