			<h3> Founder </h3>
		</div>	 -->
		<p> Chitchat was started by Moumita in 2012. A friend asked Moumita to help his mother with improving her English and Moumita agreed to do a few lessons. But soon she started getting requests from other non-English speakers travelling to San Francisco, wanting to improve their English. When she realized how much she enjoyed teaching English and helping others improve their skills, she decided to start Chitchat officialy! 

		Currently Chitchat has students across 8 countries - USA, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Chile, Japan, Korea and France. Chitchat's classes aim to make students confident English-speakers by providing them with the right tools and personalizing classes to suit specific needs of each individual student.</p>
